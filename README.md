# BadurinaLinda_Assignment3Part2
Part two of the final culmative assignment!

Note: I'm using one of the newer M2 Macbooks which are sadly not compatible with Bootcamp for Windows like older Macbooks were. 
Previous Macs made it incredibly easy to set up Windows, and I was saddened to learn that the compatibility with Bootcamp no 
longer existed long after I had already purchased it!

This of course creates some issues due to the differences in the Visual Studio versions available to me. There does not seem 
to be a way around this that does not cost a significant amount of money.

At the very beginning of the semester I was able to use a virtual machine (Parallels) to pretend I had Windows. However, once 
the free trial was up, I opted to fight my way through using VS for Mac as the cost of the VM was quite high, and I had hoped
that the issues would be relatively minor and temporary even if initially a struggle to set up. I was very wrong!

I was not able to test a couple of things due to this. I have elaborated a little on this and the specifics in the code itself.
I am hoping that it magically works on your version of VS.

Please do let me know if you have any suggestions on a workaround for this, but from what I've read my options are very limited.
